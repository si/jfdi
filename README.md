# JFDI

_Adopting the JFDI mantra in your life._

A project by [Si](https://twitter.com/Si) following a talk on [Beating Imposter Syndrome](http://sijobling.com/talks/beating-imposter-syndrome-mkgn/) and a [productivity post on getting things done](https://superyesmore.com/jfdi-fe1a0c5a2c537cbc758c71f46c62bfb3).

Very early days but, in the true essence of JFDI, this is the first attempt at doing something and will be an iterative evolution.

If you'd like to contribute or find out more, reach out to [@Si on Twitter](https://twitter.com/Si) with hashtag `#JFDI`. (Previously, [@FFSJFDIUD](https://twitter.com/ffsjfdiud) was setup but it's a bit excessive on the expletives)

### Ideas

* Feed of #JFDI hashtag tweets, photos, videosâ€¦
* To-do app with a different approach to leaving things for later
* Content to motivate and inspire others to JFDI such as meme generators and GIFs (possible opportunity for using [jfdi.design](https://jfdi.design))
* Merchandise to promote JFDI (posters, t-shirts etc)
