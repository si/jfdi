# JFDI

Adopting the JFDI mantra in your life.

A project by [Si](https://twitter.com/Si) following a talk on Beating Imposter Syndrome and a productivity post on getting things done.

Very early days but, in the true essence of JFDI, this is the first attempt at doing something and will be an iterative evolution.

If you'd like to contribute or find out more, reach out on Twitter.

## Ideas

* Feed of #JFDI hashtag tweets, photos, videos…
* To-do app with a different approach to leaving things for later
* Content to movitate and inspire others to JFDI
* Merchandise to promote JFDI (posters, t-shirts etc)
